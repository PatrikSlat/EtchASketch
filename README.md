# Etch-a-Sketch Project

## Overview

This project is a browser version of an Etch-a-Sketch, aimed at improving my DOM manipulation skills. It's a mix between a sketchpad and an Etch-a-Sketch, built entirely with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

## What I'll Learn

- **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically creating and modifying HTML elements.
- **Event Handling:** Using mouse events for interactive drawing.
- **Flexbox:** Applying Flexbox for layout, specifically for a grid of divs.
- **Responsive Design:** Adjusting the sketch grid to fit different screen sizes.
- **User Input:** Capturing user input to change the grid size for a new sketch pad.
